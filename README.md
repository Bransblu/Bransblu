### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is *Brandon Driver* and I live in Portland, Oregon. I have a passion for starting with something crude, and turning into a polished product. This, amongst other reasons, is why I have such drive to pivot into a data career. 

ðŸŒ± I'm currently learning data analysis through University of Oregon bootcamp. I am rapidly expanding on my knowledge of Python, SQL, R, Numpy, and Tableau.
